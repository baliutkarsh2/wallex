### 2. Collection and Storage of Personal Data

At Wallex, we prioritize your privacy and the security of your data. To this end, we want to clarify our data collection and storage practices:

Wallex does not collect any personal data from its users. We are committed to ensuring that your personal information remains private and secure. Any data generated or used by Wallex is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or stored in any external database.

All data related to your use of the Wallex app is stored solely on your device. This includes your preferences, settings, and any other data necessary for the app's functionality. By keeping your data local, we ensure that you maintain full control over your information.

Should you decide to delete the Wallex app from your device, all data associated with the app will be permanently deleted as well. This means that no residual data will remain on your device or on any external servers, ensuring your privacy is maintained even after you stop using our app.

Our commitment to your privacy is paramount. By not collecting or storing your personal data, we eliminate the risk of unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse of your information. You can use Wallex with the confidence that your data remains private and secure at all times.

### 3. Data Analysis Tools

To enhance the functionality and user experience of the Wallex app, we utilize Google Analytics. This service helps us understand how users interact with our app by collecting anonymous usage data. The data collected by Google Analytics includes, but is not limited to:

- The number of users and sessions
- Session duration
- Operating systems
- Device models
- Geographical locations (country level)
- App performance metrics

This information is used solely for the purpose of improving the app's performance, identifying areas for enhancement, and ensuring that we provide a high-quality user experience. It does not include any personally identifiable information and is not linked to any specific user.

The data collected through Google Analytics is anonymized and aggregated, ensuring that individual users cannot be identified. This anonymized data is stored securely and is only accessible to authorized personnel who need it to perform their job functions.

### 4. Amendments to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or to ensure compliance with applicable laws. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. The amended Privacy Policy will be accessible on our website.
